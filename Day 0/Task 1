Task-1 Create GitHub repo. Document summary of previous video in the GitHub repo

Summary:
The First lecture was about Digital VLSI SoC Design and planning 
In this lecture, we were taught about the initial overview of how applications run on hardware and how the hardware is planned to be built .
Initially, we were told about the GCC Compiler which runs on linux , where the C code of the application is written and tested, the result of which is lets say O0
First step is to create an architecture specification in which the application runs on , in C  whose output is O1 , then we refine this spec, making sure O0=O1. 
After which we make a softcopy of the hardware taking into consideration the specs which we made the previous code in Verilog, lets say the output of this is O2.
Then starts the Soc Design step where we process this RTL code separately into 2 blocks:- Processors and Peripherals/IPs . The Processors will be written in a synthesizable code bringing it down to Gate Level Netlist .
The Peripherals are divided into 2 parts :-  the Macros, which are the some of the blocks which are repeated multiple times (clock dividers etc) and Analog IPs , which are used to interact with the analog signal (ADCs and DACs) .
The processors and Macros from Peripherals can be synthesized using RTL where as the Analog IPs are made using MOSFETs . The final stage is that of SoC Integration, where these components are brought together into a single chip. 
The final output of the Soc which lets call as O3 is made sure to be equal to O2,O1,O0. Hence, making it a suitable hardware to carry out the application . Then we talk about the GDSII and the how big it is , the checks that we do for these files and the tape-out, tape-in process, etc. 
Then we discuss the difference between microprocessors and microcontrollers . After the final chip in taped-in we check the output O4 and check whether it is same as other outputs .
